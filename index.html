            <h2>The Worst Ranked Day in a Long Time</h2>

                Today was one of the worst Ranked sessions I've played in the past 5 years in any video game. I had 1 win and 4 losses. Now that doesn't seem so bad, until you realize that I lost over 85 ranking points, and demoted to a rank below. The only game I won, There was a guy on my team that did really well. 30 kills, and basically carried the game for the whole team, so it wasn't a very satisfying win. The loses on the other hand, were excrutiating. My support's went a combined 0 kills and 25 deaths. So they were no help at all, and I almost felt helpless in a lot of my games, and thats no fun either. After that I took a break to calm down, because i was getting a little too upset at a game that is supposed to be fun. So i went upstairs to play with my bunny and I found him sleeping, and it flipped my mood immediatly.

                I've been raging at ranked games a lot recently, but I think you need to play that and push yourself to get better. But tonight I played the more for fun modes and didnt really focus on the result and it went a lot better! I played Ultra Rapid Fire mostly, which is a mode in the game where you get your spells very quickly and have infinite mana, so it gets kinda crazy and chaotic. I was also playing with two of my friends which made it a lot more fun as I'm not sitting in my basement alone with no one to talk to. Like I do with most of the times I play ranked. So that was nice. I also had the company of my parents dog, Denver. He always sits next to me and begs for food whenever I'm eating so its not uncommon for him to be down here with me. But its one of the only times he lets me pet him. In case any of you are dog fans, heres what he looks like!
