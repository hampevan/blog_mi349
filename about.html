                Thats what I look like. Not much to look at. Im a 5th year senior at Michigan State University, looking to finish up a few more classes and eventually graduate after the spring semester. Im currently communting from home to save money, so I live with my parents...YAY. Going for a Bachelors in Media and Information with a focus in game design, although that didn't go so well. I have a pet rabit named Shiki that I got in October of 2021 that I love dearly, although he is a handful at the moment.<br>
